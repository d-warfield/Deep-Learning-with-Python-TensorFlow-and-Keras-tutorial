A gentle introduction to deep learning with Python, TensorFlow, and Keras

There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:



And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
print('Validation Loss:{}\nValidation Accuracy:{}'.format(val_loss, val_acc))


```python
#make predictions
predictions = model.predict([x_test])

#view model predictions for an individual indice
print(np.argmax(predictions[13]))

#view test image to check prediction
plt.imshow(x_test[13])
plt.show()
```
